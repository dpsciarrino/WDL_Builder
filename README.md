# WDL_Builder

WDL Builder is a third-party tool for generating WDL files for AutoCAD Electrical projects.

Anyone who has worked with AutoCAD Electrical template blocks has learned that WDL files are usually written by hand in a text editor such as Notepad.

WDL Builder seeks to add a GUI interface for writing WDL files.

## Features (v0.1)

- Easily open and edit existing WDL file "Line" descriptions.
- Create new WDL files.
- Add/Modify/Remove lines from a WDL file.
